# Stochastic Minimization Algorithms Comparison

This project is a simple statistical analysis of the results of comparing selected stochastic minimization algorithms. The **Random Search (PRS)** and **Multi-Start (MS)** algorithms were chosen for comparison.

The operation of the algorithms was checked based on two scalar, multimodal functions that have versions for different numbers of dimensions. The selected functions are **Ackley's function** (domain: -32.768; 32.768; minimum value: 0) and **Rosenbrock's function** (domain: -5; 10; minimum value: 0).

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the raport.html file, which is generated from the raport.Rmd file using R Markdown.
